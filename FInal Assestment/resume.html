        <p class="myself">  Web222 has been my favourite course this semester, despite having some difficulties as I go on through the semester, 
            I still found it enjoyable to learn. Due to the fact, that designing or anything that involves creativity is what I enjoy the most. 
            The early semester, everything was easy and if I am being honest, I was kind of disappointed, because the early lectures did not really contain that much designing. 
            But then as I go on through the semester, I was slowly enjoying it and it made me more productive in terms of doing research specifically web designing, 
            but then I slacked after the break, because I thought everything was going to be easy after that. As a result, these past few weeks I have been struggling to keep up, 
            because I kept missing lectures, because I was lazy which is one of my biggest regret this semester. Not being able to attend and be more responsible when it comes to 
            this course was a bad idea the topic got more complicated to the point, I had to stay up all night just to study. Even though, I had some short upcoming I still learned
             a lot of things like, form validation, markup, using CSS, Bootstrap, DOM, etc. Personally, I really liked CSS because it involved a lot of designing the domain itself. 
             As for JavaScript I really hated it felt like I was learning C language all over again. Hopefully, I can apply this in the future, since I really like designing in 
             general, especially when building my portfolio. In Conclusion, itâ€™s been fun learning this course. I loved this course very much, thanks for being an understanding and
              kind while teaching us professor. I am looking forward to the upcoming semesters of web programming. Thank you</p>
